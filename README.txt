Built using NetBeans IDE 11.1 JDK 11.0.9 and JavaFX 11.0.2

This program is intended to be ran in Canada, USA, and UK with feature for expansion if needed. This program runs in both French and English as needed and will work 
correctly in every timezone.

To run the program effectively login using "test" as the username and "test" as the password. The user enters the application as test and from there all buttons
are intuitive and work as intended. Press Add under the customer table to add a customer, edit to edit one, and delete to delete one. This also applies to the 
appointment table in addition the reporting button is under the appointment table.

The additional report I chose to run is how many customers by country to see how valuable marketing was in each country.
